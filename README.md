# Integer Linear Programming For Jobshop Scheduling Problems

We ues ILP to minimize the makespan of the job scheduling problem.

The current ILP that we use for solving the SDL-Shop Scheduling Problem is defined originally in the following paper: 
> "Mathematical models for job-shop scheduling problems with routing and 
process plan flexibility" by Özgüven et al. in Applied Mathematical Modeling (2010).
